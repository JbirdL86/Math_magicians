      An electronic calculator is typically a portable
      electronic device used to perform calculations,
      ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.

      The first solid-state electronic calculator
      was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized
      devices became available in the 1970s, especially
      after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor,
      was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator
      company Busicom. They later became used commonly
      within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).

      Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap,
      give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop
      models with built-in printers. They became popular
      in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated
      circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of
      that decade, prices had dropped to the point where
      a basic calculator was affordable to most and they
      became common in schools.
